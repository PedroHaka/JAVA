# JAVA

   Navigate through different branches on this repository to access various distinct projects, each made using Java and POO knowledge.
  While this is only a three program repository, It only contains data and code relative to my degree evaluation. 
   The codes in LG2A2 and LP1A3 are relative to my marks, and they are the final version of the projects in which I was aproved, yay me!
  Testes de implementação contains tests and other non-academical related codes.
   Be sure to know I am thankful for your time and attention, have a Nice day/night.
